        <p>
          I'm a software sales professional turned software engineer. As a seller of our product, I needed to
          understand some of the technical aspects of the product. Through learning how our product works,
          I became interested in the programming side of the tech space.
          My transition into software development began with
          learning the fundamentals of JavaScript. Through some self-learning from online resources to joining a coding
          program's workshops,
          I became intrigued with the process of problem solving and having the ablity to create.
          I decided to take a step further down this path through joining an immersive software engineering program.
          Through this program, I gained greater skills as a developer
          to create and support our ever-growing technology.
